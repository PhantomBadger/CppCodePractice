# C++ Code Samples

## Introduction

> This repository contains a selection of projects based around practicing and learning C++ coding principles. This was started as an attempt to aid in my own re-learning of C++ after coming back to it from working in C# for a few years, as well as to re-establish my knowledge of the basics.

> These projects were not uploaded with the express intent of teaching others, and were instead intended to be an online repository of my study, however anyone is welcome to use the code in here and expand upon it themselves. 

## Credits

> A large number of the projects and principles here are based off of the [https://www.caveofprogramming.com/](Cave of Programming) lessons taught by John Purcell.
